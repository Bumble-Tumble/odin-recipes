    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is made with layers of wide 
        flat noodles, tomato sauce, cheese, and meat or vegetables. The dish
         typically starts with a base layer of tomato sauce, followed by a 
         layer of noodles, then a layer of cheese and meat, and the process 
         is repeated until the dish is complete. The top layer is often finished
         off with a generous layer of cheese, which is baked to perfection until
         it's bubbly and golden brown.</p>
    <p>Lasagna is a comfort food that is loved by many around the world. It's a 
         hearty and satisfying meal that's perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying
          as leftovers. Lasagna can be customized to suit individual tastes and preferences 
          by using different types of meats or vegetables, adding herbs and spices, 
          and experimenting with different types of cheeses. Overall, lasagna is a 
          delicious and versatile dish that has stood the test of time and continues 
          to be a favorite of many.</p>

            <li>salt</li>
            <li>1/2 pound lasagna noodles</li>
            <li> 15 ounce ricotta cheese</li>
            <li> 1/12 pounds mozzeralla cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 pound freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts
                 of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large 
                 pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare 
                 the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add 
                the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.

                Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
            <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using 
                yellow bell pepper and red onions).

                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. 
                Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
                
                Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, 
                and cook for another 5 minutes.
                
                </li>
            <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed 
                tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.

                Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. 
                Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.
                
                Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, 
                tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, 
                depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)
                
                Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.
                
                Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook 
                for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so 
                nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.
                
                Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry 
                lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be 
                cooked in advance.)

                Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil 
                during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.
                
                When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles 
                that may be sticking together.
                
                Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles 
                on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. 
                This will prevent them from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Preheat to 375 degrees</li>
            <li>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of 
                the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may 
                overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.

                Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. Add half of 
                the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches. Sprinkle half the grated 
                parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.
                
                Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the 
                remaining mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.
                
                Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles 
                and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
                
                </li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). 
                Bake at 375Â°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat 
                it in a conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil 
                from touching the sauce.)</li>
        </ol>
